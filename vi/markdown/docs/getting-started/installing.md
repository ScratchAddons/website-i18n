## From source

{{< admonition info >}}
Unlike the store releases, installing from source requires a browser based on Chromium 121+ or Firefox 121+.

### About GitHub releases

[The releases page](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/releases) contains the code and installation files for all development builds of Scratch Addons, as well as the mirror of the store builds.

### Cloning the repository

This is the recommended way to install Scratch Addons for development purposes, assuming you have Git installed.

If you plan on contributing, fork the repository on GitHub first and then clone the fork, replacing `<username>` with your Github username.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/<username>/ScratchAddons.git
```
To update Scratch Addons, first `cd` into its folder, and then run the following commands.

```sh
$ git fetch
$ git pull
```

Remember to also update Scratch Addons from the browser.


### Downloading the Zip

{{< admonition warning >}}
  This method is not recommended for development unless Git cannot be installed on the system since it will need to be manually repeated every time you update Scratch Addons.
{{< /admonition >}}

If you don not have Git installed, use this method instead.

1. Go to the [repository](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons) and find the download code button.

1. Click it and select "Download ZIP".

1. Extract the archive into a folder.

### Installing on Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge

To load the extension into Google Chrome and most Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Opera, Brave or Vivaldi:

1. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)

1. Turn on "Developer mode" in the top-right corner

1. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `ScratchAddons` folder.

To update the extension when testing, click the refresh icon on the extension's card.

{{< admonition info >}}
  The "Unrecognized manifest key" warnings may safely be ignored, since they are required by Firefox.

### Installing on Mozilla Firefox

To load the extension into Mozilla Firefox:

{{< admonition info >}}
  Addons loaded into Firefox this way are temporary and must be reloaded every time the browser is restarted. Because of this Chrome is recommended for development, but everything is still expected to work on Firefox.
{{< /admonition >}}

1. Go to [about:debugging](about:debugging)

1. Click "This Firefox" on the sidebar

1. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."

1. Select the `manifest.json` file in the `ScratchAddons` folder.

1. If a permission tab opens, click the "Enable" button.

To reload the extension when testing, click the "Reload" button on the extension's card.

{{< admonition info >}}
  The unexpected WebExtension manifest property warnings may safely be ignored, since they are required by Chrome.
