Ta strona zawiera listę najczęściej zadawanych pytań odnoszących się do dodatku Scratch Addons

## General questions

### Co to Scratch Addons?

Dodatki Scratch to rozszerzenie przeglądarki „wszystko w jednym” dla strony internetowej Scratch i edytora projektów. Zapewnia funkcje i motywy (nazywane wewnętrznie dodatkami), zarówno dla strony internetowej Scratch, jak i edytora projektu. Misją Scratch Addons jest połączenie wszystkich istniejących rozszerzeń Scratch, skryptów użytkownika i stylów użytkownika, opracowanych przez kilku członków społeczności Scratch, w jedno, i stworzyć łatwo dostępne miejsce, jednocześnie pozwalając użytkownikom wybrać, które z nich włączyć. 

### Who created Scratch Addons?

Scratch Addons is a team project led by World_Languages. You can find the list of people who have contributed to us on [the Credits page](/credits). While the "Scratch Messaging" and "Developer tools" addons were initially created by griffpatch, he does not maintain the extension.

### What does Scratch Addons include?

Scratch Addons includes over 100 addons, which can be enabled or disabled individually. Some addons can also be further configured, and some have presets, such as dark mode for the website theme. Scratch Addons also includes a popup, which can be used to quickly access messages, cloud games, and the settings page. Scratch Addons is translated into multiple languages, including German, French, Spanish, and Japanese.

### Is this the same as TurboWarp Addons?

[TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/) has some addons from Scratch Addons which can be used on their editor without installing Scratch Addons. However, Scratch Addons also includes addons for the Scratch website and the popup display. Therefore, it is still useful to have Scratch Addons even if you only code using TurboWarp.

## System requirements

### What are the system requirements for Scratch Addons?

Scratch Addons is officially supported on the desktop versions of [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome/) (version 96 and up), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) (version 96 and up), and [Mozilla Firefox](https://mozilla.org/firefox/) (version 109 and up), and should also work on other desktop browsers that are based on those browsers. Please check out [this page](../getting-started/installing/) for complete information.

### Can I use Scratch Addons on a mobile device?

**For Android users**: Yes, Scratch Addons can now be installed on [Firefox for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox), but it is not recommended yet since Scratch Addons' UI is not well-tested on touchscreens or environments with small screen sizes so some features might not work as expected. Alternatively, if you prefer Chrome you could try the [Kiwi Browser](https://kiwibrowser.com/).

**For iOS and iPadOS users**: Sadly, it is not. App Store policy does not allow browser implementations to be uploaded, which means all browsers available on that platform are just re-skinned Safari. This causes some problems (see below).

### Can I use Scratch Addons on Safari?

Currently, you cannot.

First, Safari extension store requires all developers to pay an annual fee to list extensions on the store. As Scratch Addons team does not have a source of income, this makes it very hard to maintain the extension. There is also a technical problem with the implementation of browser extensions in Safari which makes some of the core features to be unusable.

### Can I use Scratch Addons on the offline editor?

Scratch Addons cannot be used on the official Scratch application, including the offline editor.

As an alternative, most of the project editor addons are available on [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/) which has a [downloadable app](https://desktop.turbowarp.org/) for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Additionally, on browsers that support Progressive Web Applications (PWA) such as Google Chrome, you can also install the TurboWarp editor as a PWA and use it without an internet connection.

### Are there any incompatible programs?

Some browser extensions and userscripts may interfere with Scratch Addons. If you experience issues, you should try disabling these:

- Scratch 3 Developer Tools: This browser extension is a copy of the Developer tools addon. You should uninstall the Developer Tools browser extension and turn on the addon instead.
- Better3.0: This browser extension can interfere with some addons. Luckily, most of its features are also available as addons.

## Security and privacy

### Czy Scratch Addons jest bezpieczne?

Yes. Scratch Addons should not have any security issues in its most recent version. Scratch Addons is an open source project, so the code has been reviewed by Scratch Addons contributors. Additionally, Chrome Web Store, Add-ons for Firefox, and Microsoft Edge Add-ons review each new version of Scratch Addons before publishing it on their stores.

### Jak mogę zgłosić lukę w zabezpieczeniach? 

If you happen to find a security vulnerability, please contact World_Languages privately by emailing `worldxlanguages (at) gmail.com`. If you don't get a response within 48 hours, please [create an issue](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/issues/) mentioning that you had sent an email.

You can either [read our security policy](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/security/policy) or [check our advisories that we have published](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/security/advisories?state=published).

### Czy moje konto będzie bezpieczne podczas korzystania z Scratch Addons? 

Yes. Features related to your Scratch account are thoroughly reviewed by Scratch Addons contributors to ensure that they will not harm your Scratch account. Scratch Addons keeps your account credentials secure, and it will not modify or delete your projects or assets without your permission. However, you may use the extension without any account-related features if you so choose.

## Using Scratch Addons

### How do I enable addons?

To enable addons, first go to the settings by:

- opening the popup and clicking the gear icon on the top-right corner
- going to https://scratch.mit.edu/scratch-addons-extension/settings. Note: you must have the extension installed for this link to work.

Then, find addons you'd like to enable using the sidebar or the search box. To enable an addon, click the switch on the right side of the addon tile.

### Czy mogę mówić osobom o Scratch Addons na stronie Scratch?

You can't, and please don't. There is a policy that forbids mentioning browser extensions/userscripts [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/post/2907564/), and violations have resulted in Scratch Team removing posts or muting accounts. You may, however, use different methods to tell your friends about Scratch Addons.

### Jeśli Scratch Addons zwalnia Scratch to co mam zrobić?

You can try disabling addons that you don't need, especially complex features such as the variables tab, debugger, and cat blocks that watch the mouse pointer. Most addons with a performance impact will provide a warning in the extended addon information.

Some specific advices:
- Turn off 60FPS addon. While the addon can increase the maximum speed a project can run, it does not reduce lags. To run such projects faster, use [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/).
- "Variable manager" addon should not be used while the project is running.

### I cannot receive notifications. Why?

First, disable and re-enable the "Scratch Notifier" addon. This can fix some issues.

If the problem continues, then check the operating system's notification settings. You have to allow the browser - such as Google Chrome - to send notifications. 

- Windows: Open Settings, open the "Notifications & actions" category, then find "Change notification settings for individual senders". Read [Microsoft's help article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-notification-settings-in-windows-8942c744-6198-fe56-4639-34320cf9444e) for more detailed information.
- macOS: Open System Preferences, then open the Notifications section. Select the browser (e.g. Google Chrome) on the left and enable notifications. Read [Apple's help article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204079) for more detailed information.

You should also make sure that "focus assist" (on Windows) or "Do Not Disturb" (on macOS) is disabled.

### How do I watch recordings made with the project video recorder addon?

Due to technical limitations, videos recorded with this addon are in the WebM format. You can view .webm files using your browser (by dragging and dropping the file) or by using a media player that supports it, such as [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/).

To convert WebM files into MP4 or other formats, you can use a video conversion software that supports WebM, such as [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) or [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/webm-to-mp4), although we recommend simply viewing these files with a browser or media player. Note that this can take a long time depending on the size of the video.

### Jak mogę włączyć Ukryte Dodatki?

Aby pokazać ukryte dodatki należy w menu ustawień, wpisać Konami Code  (↑↑↓↓←→←→BA). Gdy to zrobisz, w tym miejscu pojawią się Easter Eggi, które możesz wtedy włączyć.

Niektóre z Dodatków Niespodzianek to "Zamień litery na drukowanie" i "Błąd przecinka". Zobacz [listę dodatków](/addons), aby poznać ich listę.

## Technical

### Co to "dodatek" dokładniej?

An addon is similar to an extension or a userscript, but they use special APIs provided by the Scratch Addons extension. These APIs allow addons to run scripts on a Scratch page (userscripts), run scripts on the background (persistent scripts), or apply styles to the Scratch website (userstyles).

Userscripts can use the `addon.*` JavaScript APIs, which allow them to obtain Scratch-related information (for example, the currently logged in user) and use extension APIs (like sending notifications).

### Jeśli wszystko to dodatek, więc co robi Scratch Addons?

By itself, Scratch Addons is just an addon loader. Its main tasks are to:

- Pozwalać użytkownikom włączać, wyłączać oraz ustawiać dodatki
- Sterować dodatkami i dawać im API.
- Provide useful data to addons (for example, the addon.auth API).
- Naprawiać błędy strony Scratch.
- Zapewniać sposoby uzyskiwania dostępu do stanu Redux i modyfikowania go. 
- Zapobiega nakładaniu się kodu dodatków na siebie.
- Importuje biblioteki, które są wykorzystywane przez wiele dodatków jednocześnie.
