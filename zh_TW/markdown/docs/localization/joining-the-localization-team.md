## Content available for translation

#### Scratch Addons browser extension

- **General Translation.** These are ~150 text strings which are used by the extension. Users can only see these translations for their language if 90% of general strings were translated.

- **Addons Translation.** These text strings include addon names, descriptions, settings, and other text strings used by addons. Users can only see these translations if the general translation is already available and 80% of addon strings were translated. There are over 1000 addon strings available for translation.
