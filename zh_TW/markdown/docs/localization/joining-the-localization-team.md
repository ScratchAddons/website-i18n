感謝您有興趣協助將 Scratch Addons 翻譯成其他語言！在世界各地志工的幫助下，Scratch Addons 現已提供超過 15 種語言版本。

請仔細閱讀此頁以繼續。

## 加入翻譯員的要求

* 您必須是**精通英語的人**
* 例如，您可以使用英語的 Scratch Addons 設定頁面，或者如果您可以了解 griffpatch 的影片，那麼您的英語就很流利。
反之，如果你在沒有翻譯的情況下很難理解句子，那麼你就不夠流利。
* 您必須翻譯你的**母語**
* 您必須有一個電子郵件地址，最好每周至少檢查一次。
* 你必須在[Scratch網站](https://scratch.mit.edu)上有一個帳號

{{< admonition info >}}
**These languages do NOT accept new translators:** Italian, Spanish.<!-- This list of languages is also found below. Remember to update both. -->
{{< /admonition >}}

如果您不是母語但認為自己足夠流利，您也可以請求加入。請記住，參加一些語言課程並不能讓您變得流利。如果您不將智慧型手機的系統語言更改為它，那麼您就不夠流利！

我們僅支援 Scratch 本身支援的語言。我們也完全支援 RTL 語言，例如阿拉伯語和希伯來語。

## 可翻譯的內容

### Scratch Addons 瀏覽器擴充

- **General Translation.** These are ~150 text strings which are used by the extension. Users can only see these translations for their language if 90% of general strings were translated.

- **Addons Translation.** These text strings include addon names, descriptions, settings, and other text strings used by addons. Users can only see these translations if the general translation is already available and 80% of addon strings were translated. There are over 1000 addon strings available for translation.
