{{< admonition info >}}
If you found a **translation mistake/error** in Scratch Addons, please [send feedback](/feedback) about it.
{{< /admonition >}}

Scratch Addons is available in more than 15 languages thanks to the help of volunteers around the world.

## Requirements to join as a translator

* You must be **FLUENT IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE**.
* For example, you're fluent in English if you can use the Scratch Addons settings page in English, or if you understand griffpatch's videos. If you struggle to understand sentences without a translator, you're not fluent.
* You must be **a NATIVE SPEAKER** of the language you want to translate to.
* You must have an email address, which you should ideally check at least once a week.
* You must own an account on [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu).

{{< admonition info >}}
**These languages do NOT accept new translators:** Italian, Spanish.
<!-- This list of languages is also found below. Remember to update both. -->
{{< /admonition >}}

If you're not a native speaker but consider yourself fluent enough, you may also request to join. Keep in mind taking some language classes does not make you fluent. If you wouldn't change your smartphone's system language to it, you're not fluent enough!

We only support languages that Scratch itself supports. We also fully support RTL languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew.

## Content available for translation

### Scratch Addons browser extension

- **General Translation.** These are ~150 text strings which are used by the extension. Users can only see these translations for their language if 90% of general strings were translated.

- **Addons Translation.** These text strings include addon names, descriptions, settings, and other text strings used by addons. Users can only see these translations if the general translation is already available and 80% of addon strings were translated. There are over 1000 addon strings available for translation.
